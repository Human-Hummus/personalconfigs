# Configs for my personal laptop

Most information (and todolist, etc.) can be found [on my website: www.humanhummus.com](www.humanhummus.com).

The goal of this config is to be power-efficient, and usable for *me*.

User account must be called "user"

Run `distfiles.sh full` as super user to update permissions, distribute files etc. Run without the `full` option to just copy the files.

These files are meant, as many file names would imply, to be run on [Gentoo Linux](https://www.gentoo.org/).
